Pendiente Questionable Questions...

What’s the secret, where’s the light
How to live a better life?

Does the answer come from reasoning
Or from choices in our hearts
Is the game to find the answer
Is it here or miles apart?

What’s the color of the answer
Is it white or is it black
Would it be too late already
When we get our answer back?
