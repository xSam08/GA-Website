What is love I'm asking you
Have you felt it, could you describe it
Have you cried or started laughing
With the touch of someone's hand?

What is love, I want to know
Is it what I am now feeling
Why is it I can not explain it
If it's in every part of me.

What is love, I'd like to know
So I can give words to my song
And when I sing them you'll remember
If you've ever been in love.

Can you tell me what love is
Or should we not try to define it
Should we just let it surprise us
Like an unexpected gift.

And maybe then we'll just enjoy
And get wrapped up in the feeling
And although we can not define it
It will fill us up with joy.

So what is love, I'd like to know
So I can give words to my song
And when I sing them you'll remember
If you've ever been in love.
