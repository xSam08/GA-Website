Pendiente What a Life That Would be...

If I could listen more than I talk
If I could cool my head not my heart
If I could look ahead not behind
If I could leave my fears not my will.

What a wonderful life that would be
How much joy to my heart it would bring.

If I would speak if I have something to say
If I would laugh instead of just being upset
If I would hug instead of pushing away
And forget instead of dwelling on what hurts.

What a wonderful life that would be
How much joy to my heart it would bring
What a life that would be.

All I know is that I’m willing to try
And if I don’t I will miss
The chance to be what I can.

Day by day and one step at a time
Knowing that sometimes I’ll fall
I want to walk down this road.

If I could see instead of closing my eyes
If I could feel rather than turning to stone
If I could cry instead of hiding my tears
If I could dream but believe that it’s real.

What a wonderful life that would be
How much joy to my heart it would bring
What a life that would be.

All I know is that I’m willing to try
And if I don’t I will miss
The chance to be what I can.
