Pendiente The World is Going Mad...

Looking at what’s happening
Around the world it seems
The world is going mad.

Me above the We
Creed against religion
Color against color of our skin.

The world’s going mad.

How to tell what’s true
Who can give us answers?
If there are a million lying voices.

Planning to live on Mars
Knowing we’ll kill our planet
The world is going mad, the world is going mad.

So what to do, is there a solution?
How to work together not apart?
Memory seems to fade in a few years
How can we forget what go us here.

Has it always been the same
Or is it worse than ever
I guess human nature never changes.

With the Right against the Left
And equally divided
We are paralyzed, and almost nothing ever happens.

The world’s going mad.

So what to do, is there a solution?
How to work together not apart?
Memory seems to fade in a few years
How can we forget what got us here.

Looking at what’s happening
Around the world it seems
The world is going mad.
