Pendiente This Road...

When I think of where I’m going
I remember where I’ve been
Every place has left an imprint
That has helped me cope with change.

If you ask “has it been easy?”
I would really have to say
Every change has come with challenge
But I wouldn’t change a thing.

Because this road has shaped me
And made me who I am
And I have learned with every turn
And come out stronger in the end.

When I look at all the faces
Of the friends I’ve made so far
And the friendships that are growing
I know I’ve won a prize.

In the high and in the low times
At each facet of my life
It’s their helping hands and caring
That have gotten me this far.

Because they too have shaped me
And made me who I am
And I have learned with every turn
And come out stronger in the end. (bis)
