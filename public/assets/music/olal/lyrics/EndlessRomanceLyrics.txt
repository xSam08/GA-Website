Pendiente Endless Romance...

The sun is going down
I listen to the waves Iâ€™m here with you...

I like it when you say you love me
And hold me close
I like it when we dance and you only see
One shadow on the wall.

I like when the wind goes through you hair
The moon is in your eyes
Our lips meet in a kiss
Time seems to disappear.

The stars are shining now
Your eyes are pulling
The string of my heart
I want this night with you to last forever
Until the end of time.

I want to tell you a million things
Without saying any words
So close your eyes and I will take you
To places you have never been.

The sky, your hair, your skin next to mine
La playa, tu risa, tu cuerpo mi cielo.

I like it when you say you love me
And hold me close
I like it when we dance and you only see
One shadow on the wall.

Oh baby dance with me tonight
Be with me to the end of time.
