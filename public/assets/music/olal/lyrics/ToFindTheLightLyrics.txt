How could I find the words to explain?
Go deep in my mind to understand
How I feel and what I want with my life
Maybe I’m not so smart or so wise
To find the light.

Is it that I expect far too much?
Am I looking for something I already have?
It’s not that I’m ungrateful, I am a lucky guy
But I want the purpose I once had
And walk a meaningful path.

This is my wish
That my compass will show
Once more clearly the way
That I find the fire
To give my heart the passion it seeks
A voice to my soul
A spring in my step
To wish for days without end.

Is the weight of the years to blame?
Or the marks left by things I have lived?
Is the cycle of seasons that says
After you plant you should sit and rest
Until it is time to plant once again.

This is my wish... (bis)
