Pending What do You do?...

What do you do
If you are feeling blue
What do you do
When things don’t go the way you want.

What do you do
If you are feeling lonely
What do you do
When the sun is out but you only see the clouds.

Wouldn’t you like to know
How to turn the page
And let the clouds go by.

Because it’s only you
Who can decide
To leave the past behind
Forget about the things
You can’t control
And change the ones you can.

What do you do
When you are feeling sorry
What do you do
With the things you said
Or with the ones you held.

What do you do
If you are feeling lost
What do you do
When there is no map
And you can’t find your north.

Wouldn’t you like to know
How to turn the page
And let the clouds go by.

Because it’s only you
Who can decide
To leave the past behind
Forget about the things
You can’t control
And change the ones you can.
