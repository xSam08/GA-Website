The lines in my hand
Walking trough old Habana
An old lady said to me
For a little bit of your money
I will tell you all about your life.

Señora, what is your name
I am Elda, let me see your hand
I showed her my palm
and asked how much I had to pay.

And she said, It is not how much you pay
But if you really want to know what lies in your future
The past, you already know, the present is right here with me
And your future, only I know.

I have to say she got me by surprise
But I found her words so wise
Do I want to know my future
Or should I make it one present at a time.

So I took her hand and said
By barely looking at my hand
You just gave me precious advise
The kind that money just can’t buy.

Well miss Elda you got me thinking
But I’ll let my future be unknown
Come with me, let’s have a mojito
So you can tell me all about your life.

With a smile she grabbed my arm
And said I know the perfect bar
And with her stories she took me back
To the presents she once had.

It is not how much you pay
But if you really want to know what lies in your future
The past, you already know, the present is right here with me
And your future, only I know. (bis)
