What’s the day
without the smile from the sun
What’s the night
without the light from the stars
What’s my life
Without you, my love by my side?

How would I know I am not in a dream
How would I find peace in my heart
How would I breathe
Without you, my love by my side?

Like the day follows the night
And shadows the light
My love will always follow you.

Like the rain falls to the ground
And the stream runs to the sea
My love will always find you.

What’s my song without you in its lines?
What’s my sleep without you in my dreams?
What are my arms
Without you to hold in the night?

Like a bird’s migrating flight
or an arrow searching it’s mark
My love goes straight to you
wherever you are.

Like the day follows the night
And shadows the light
My love will always follow you.

Like the rain falls to the ground
And the stream runs to the sea
My love will always find you.
