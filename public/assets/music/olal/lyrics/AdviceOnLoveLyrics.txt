Pendiente Advice on Love...

Is it possible to give advice on love?
Can you really tell a heart what road to take?
Is it possible to feel somebody’s pain?
Or to say there’s always sunshine after rain
Is it possible at all to give advice on love?

Can you express with words alone what you’ve been through?
Can you share the laughs and tears you’ve shed along
Is it possible to give somebody else
The chance of knowing more about themselves
The way they do through love, the way they do through love.

And I could give you a million quotes on love
But that will never be enough
And I could show you a million pictures
Of hearts, rainbows and embracing figures
But that will never be enough
To give you advise on love.

Can you tell about the things that you can’t see?
Can you explain the reasons you don’t understand?
You can be self-assured but don’t know what to say
Be strong now and so fragile the next day
So can you give advise on love,
if you may need it for yourself?

And I could give you a million quotes on love… (bis)
