Pending Is Love Worth Waiting For?...

After all that I’ve lived
I wonder is love for me
Is the pain to see it through
Too much to pay for what I’ve got.

Like the waves on the shore
I’ve seen love come and go
Laughter followed by tears
And my heart broken once more.

Should I still believe
That one day i’ll find my true love
How can I resist
Another closing door
Another “I have to let you go”.

How can I mend
The pieces of my broken dreams
How can I forget the sleepless nights
Trying to answer why, trying to answer why...

So I ask, once again
Is love worth waiting for
Or should I just be content
With the simpler things I can control.

Have I been to naive
To think that love is for me
When it is a rare possession
Of the few that life has blessed.

Should I still believe
That one day I’ll find my true love
How can I resist another closing door
Another “I have to let you go”.

How can I mend
The pieces of my broken dreams
How can I forget the sleepless nights
Trying to answer why, trying to answer why...
