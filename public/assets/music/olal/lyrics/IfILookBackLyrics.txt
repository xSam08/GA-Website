Pending If I Look Back...

If I look back I see the road
That brought me here to where I am
I see old friends and lovers past
I see the days that had no end.

I can see the fences that I used to climb
And never being afraid of falling
I remember hitching mi wagon to the stars
Never thinking how I would get back.

If I look back I see I can choose
To bring the bad or bring the good
From the bad I got what I had to learn
And from the good the joy to try.

And I did fall from fences and yes, I felt the pain
Iâ€™m still learning to choose the ones worth climbing
And my wagon took me to places faraway
Never loosing sight of where I started.

If I look back I see the road
That brought me here to where I am
I see old friends and lovers past
I see the days that had no end.

I can see the fences that I used to climb
And never being afraid of falling
I remember hitching mi wagon to the stars
Never thinking how I would get back.
