Tell me that you love me if you do
Like I love you
Tell me that you miss me if you do
Like I miss you
Cause without you the days seem long
And the week has four days more
and the nights are not enough
to dream of you, not wanting to wake up
 
When I am with you, I’m in heaven
Miles from the ground
Dancing in the clouds
When I’m with you, all is clear
No doubts in my mind
I feel fine if you are near

I don’t know how to tell you how I feel
And my heart aches in silence
There is a place inside me where I have
A million words to tell you
That I want to live my life with you
And watch the seasons pass
Have as many dreams as there are stars
And walk the road, always by your side

When I am with you, I’m in heaven
Miles from the ground
Dancing in the clouds
When I’m with you, all is clear
No doubts in my mind
I feel fine if you are near
