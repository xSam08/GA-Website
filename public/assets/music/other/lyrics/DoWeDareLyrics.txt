What do we see when we close our eyes?
What do we hear when there is no sound?
Who’s by our side 
when there is no one around?

Do we dare
Take the chance
To feel what it’s like to be on our own?

And we find that what is real
Is within our heart, our soul 
a voice telling us what we need to hear
we just need to trust what’s revealed 

What do we do when we don’t understand?
What do we do to find the light
What path to take 
To get to where we want to be

Do we dare
Take the chance
To feel what it’s like to be on our own?

And we find that what is real
Is inside our heart, our soul 
a voice that tells us what we need to hear
we just need to trust what’s revealed
