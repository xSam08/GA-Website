It seems a million years ago
When my kids were born
And now they have children of their own

Where have all those years gone
Living life I guess
And here I am talking to myself

If I could go back in time
I would tell them it’ll be alright
Don’t worry about the future, take it easy

Do the very best you can
Live the moment, it’s all you have
Love and laugh a lot, be dreamers

Time flies and you don’t realize
The choices you’ve made brought you where you are
And sometimes life just deals you the wrong hand

You bet with the cards you have,
Sometimes you win and others you understand
That loosing ain’t so bad if you remember…

If I could go back in time
I would tell myself it’ll be alright
Don’t worry about the future, take it easy

Do the very best you can
Live the moment it’s all you have
Love and laugh a lot, be a dreamer!

It seems a million years ago
And I’ve come to realize
That each day we have the chance
To start a new life
