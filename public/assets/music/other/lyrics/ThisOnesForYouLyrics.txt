This one is for you
And I hope it makes you happy
This is just to tell you
That I love you and 
I am lost without you 

This one is for you
The one who feels like sunshine
You are my wings and the reason
My music comes out to meet you

This one is for you
The one I adore
After two hundred seasons
This one is for you
The one I always loved
Since your wish on the bridge
This one is for you
    
This one is for you
And I hope it makes you happy
This is just to tell you
That I love you and 
I am lost without you 

This one is for you
The one who feels like sunshine
You are my wings and the reason
My music comes out to meet you
