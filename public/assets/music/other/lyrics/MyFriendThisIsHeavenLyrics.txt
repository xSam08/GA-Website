I traveled south of Miami
two hundred miles from the shore
where the weather is always sunny
where the dancing never stops

I came to wash away my sorrows
And the pain of my lost love
And bring sun into the darkness
That she left when she was gone

My friend, this is heaven
There's no place I'd rather be    
    Amigo mio este es el cielo
    Y aquí es donde yo quiero estar
Where the waves write the stories
Stories in the sand
    Donde las olas escriben historias
    En las arenas del mar

My friend, this is heaven
I wish you were here with me
    Amigo mio este es el cielo
    Ojalá estuvieras aquí
So you could close your eyes
And think you don’t have to leave
    Y que cerraras tus ojos
    Y no te tuvieras que ir

I left my blue jeans in my cabin
They said my drink was on its way
And the breeze was blowing
Blowing my worries away

I have to say by coming here
I found what I was looking for
I got some color on my skin
And found solace for my soul

My friend, this is heaven... (repeat)
