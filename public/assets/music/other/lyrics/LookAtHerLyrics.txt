I see her through my window
And my heart skips a beat
It’s like I’ve seen a vision
That I was meant to see.   

I wish I had a magic spell 
to make this moment stay 
To freeze her in this instant 
before she walks away

I am already in love
And I haven’t met her yet!
Perhaps it’s serendipity
Cause she turned and looked my way!

I wonder if she is
The one I’m looking for
Or if it is just a cruel trick
My mind is playing on me

I see her through my window
And my heart skips a beat
It’s like I’ve seen a vision
That I was meant to see.     
  
I wish I had a magic spell 
to make this moment stay 
To freeze her in this instant 
before she walks away

I am already in love
And I haven’t met her yet !
Perhaps it’s serendipity
Cause she turned and looked my way!

I wonder if she feels the same
Or if she’ll   ever know
That in my dreams, I take her hand
And never let it go
